# NFL Game Predictor — CLAUDE.md

## What This Is

Personal NFL prediction tool. Two modes: **winner** (outright result) and **cover** (beats the spread). Rules-based engine, weighted factors, confidence scores with drill-down reasoning. Season-long accuracy tracking to evaluate and tune the model. JWT auth; `AUTH_DISABLED=true` for local dev.

## Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLite, `nflreadpy`, OddspaPI (primary), The Odds API (fallback), Open-Meteo (weather)
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript strict, Vite, Tailwind
- **Testing:** pytest (backend), Vitest (frontend)
- **Dev tooling:** `ruff`, `make`, VS Code tasks

## Critical Rules

### Spread sign convention — verify before touching spread code
This has been silently reversed multiple times.
- `get_spread()` and `spread` in cache = **positive = home favoured** (nflverse convention)
- OddspaPI / The Odds API = **negative = home favoured** (bookmaker). `_find_live_spread()` in `betting_lines.py` negates on read.
- **Never negate the cached `spread` field** — it is stored as-is from `get_spread()`.
- Home covers when `actual_margin > raw_spread`.

### Skipped vs disabled
- `supporting_data["skipped"] = True` → data unavailable → weight forced to 0
- `weight = 0.0` → intentionally disabled → data may still be present
- These are different. Do not conflate them. Check `supporting_data["skipped"]`, not `weight == 0`.

### Do not modify
- `predict()`, `_run_factors()`, or existing winner-mode factor files for cover changes
- `FactorResult`, `PredictionResult`, `CoverPredictionResult` response shapes
- The 6 new cover factors' default weights (must stay 0.0 until optimised)

## Architecture

### Factor scores
All factors: score in **[-100, +100]**, positive = home advantage, `game_date` param for leakage gating.

### Winner factors (6)
`form`, `ats_form`, `rest_advantage`, `betting_lines`, `coaching_matchup`, `weather_factor`
All use `calculate(schedules, team_stats, home, away, week, season, game_date=None)` signature.

### Cover factors (12)
Winner factors + `pythagorean_regression`, `epa_differential`, `success_rate`, `turnover_regression`, `game_script`, `market_signals`.
New cover factors use direct function calls (not `calculate()`), with custom signatures accepting `spread`, `live_odds`, etc. They are appended in `predict_cover()` after `_run_factors()`, then `_normalize_weights()` is called once more on the merged list.

### PBP data (`app/data/pbp_stats.py`)
`nflreadpy` → Polars → `.to_pandas()`. Cached to `data/pbp_{season}.parquet`. Module-level `_pbp_cache` for in-process reuse. `get_team_pbp_stats(team, season, week_cutoff, game_date, decay)` is the main entry point. Returns `TeamPbpStats` dataclass; all fields `None` if `games_sampled < 3`.

### Margin calibration split
Two independent pairs in `calibration.py`:
- `MARGIN_SLOPE` / `MARGIN_INTERCEPT` — winner-calibrated (from `optimise_weights.py`), informational only
- `COVER_MARGIN_SLOPE` / `COVER_MARGIN_INTERCEPT` — cover-calibrated (from `optimise_cover_weights.py`), used by `predict_cover()`, cover APIs, backtest cover mode, and `analyse_confidence --target cover`. Falls back to winner pair if not set in `.env`.

### Score caches
Two separate JSON caches in `data/`:
- `score_cache.json` / `score_cache_full_history.json` — 6 winner factors (used by winner backtest and `optimise_weights.py`)
- `cover_score_cache.json` / `cover_score_cache_full_history.json` — 12 cover factors (used by cover backtest and `optimise_cover_weights.py`)

### Weight override in `_run_factors()`
Factors return `supporting_data["skipped"]=True` → always weight=0 regardless of profile. Factors with weight=0 in winner settings CAN have non-zero weight in cover profile. Do not simplify this — the two cases are intentionally different.

## Code Conventions

- Type hints on all signatures; Pydantic models for API schemas; Google-style docstrings
- `ruff` lint + format, `line-length = 100`; TypeScript `strict: true`, no `any`
- Commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`
- No dead code; no commented-out blocks; no speculative abstractions
- Real tuned weights live in `backend/.env` (gitignored) — never read, print, or log that file
